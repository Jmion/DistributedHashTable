# Projet de Programation orientée système
## Data collection
The data collection for this project was done by using bash scripts. The only modification to the C programm was adding a timer and writing the time to a file.
## What we did.
We did the entire project. Everything should be implemented.
## Number of hours
More than we expected for 2 credits, but it is hard to give an actual number since our workload was spread out into many small parts in public transporation.
